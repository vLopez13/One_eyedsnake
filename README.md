It's a game between the computer vs the human player involving dice. The objective of the game is the first one to reach 50 points wins! 
How to play: The player whose turn will roll the dice, if the player doesn't roll a double then the player gains points on their round but if the dice rolls a double the player automatically loses their points in the round and passes it to the next player. The player who doesn't roll a double will be asked if they want to go again.
